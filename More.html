                <p>
                    The culture of Spain is based on a variety of historical influences, primarily based on Roman, Celtic and Iberian culture.
                    [citation needed] Other ancient peoples such as Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Greeks also had some influence. In the areas of
                    language and also religion, the Ancient Romans left an essential legacy in the Spanish culture because Rome created Hispania
                    as a political, legal and administrative unit.[1] The subsequent course of Spanish history added other elements to the
                    country's culture and traditions. The Visigothic Kingdom left a united Christian Hispania that was going to be welded
                    in the Reconquista. The Visigoths kept the Roman legacy in Spain between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Early
                    Middle Ages.[2] Around 75% of modern Spanish language is derived from Latin. Ancient Greek has also contributed
                    substantially to Spanish vocabulary, especially through Latin, where it had a great impact.[3] Spanish vocabulary
                    has been in contact with Basque, Iberian, Celtic, Gothic, Nahuatl, Quechua, Taino or Arabic (around 8% of its vocabulary
                    has this origin). Another influence was the minority Jewish population in some cities.

                <h2>Cinema</h2><br>

                <p>
                    In recent years,[when?] Spanish cinema, including within Spain and Spanish filmmakers abroad, has achieved high marks of
                    recognition as a result of its creative and technical excellence.[citation needed] In the long history of Spanish cinema, the great filmmaker
                    Luis Buñuel was the first to achieve universal recognition, followed by Pedro Almodóvar in the 1980s. Spanish cinema has also seen international
                    success over the years with films by directors like Segundo de Chomón, Florián Rey, Luis García Berlanga, Carlos Saura, Julio Medem and
                    Alejandro Amenábar. Woody Allen, upon receiving the prestigious Prince of Asturias Award in 2002 in Oviedo remarked: "when I left
                    New York, the most exciting film in the city at the time was Spanish, Pedro Almodóvar's one. I hope that Europeans will continue to
                    lead the way in filmmaking because at the moment not much is coming from the United States."
